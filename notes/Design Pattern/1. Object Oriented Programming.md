# Object Oriented Programming

## Definition

> A *programming paradigm* based on the concept "object", which can contain data and code: data in the form of *fields*(properties) and code in the form of *procedures*(methods).

## Object Oriented Programming Languages

Languages that support this paradigm.

## Properties

1. Encapsulation

   - A class does not allow calling code to access internal object data and permits access through methods only(**data hiding**).
   - syntax support: *access modifiers*(`private`, `protected`, `public`).

2. Abstraction
   - reveal members that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding implementation code.
   - can't be instantiated into objects.
   - It's sometimes excluded for the reason that it did not need syntax to support indeed.
   - syntax support: `interface`, `abstract`.

3. Inheritance
   - represents **'is-a-type-of'** relationship.
   - subclass can override the methods defined by superclass.
   - it's controversial, it somtimes considers an *anti-pattern*. -> *more composition and less inheritance*.

4. Polymorphism
   1. through inheritance:
      - can use subclass to replace superclass.
      - syntax support:
        1. inheritance.
        2. assign a subclass object to a superclass object variable.
        3. subclass methods can override superclass methods.
   2. through interface.
   3. duck-typing:
      - as long as the classes has methods with the same name, like phython and javascript(dynamic programming language).
