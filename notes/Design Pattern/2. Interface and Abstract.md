# Interface and Abstract

## Abstract Type

### Concepts

- a type in a nonominative type system that cannot be instantiated directly, whereas a *concrete type* can.
- *is-a-type-of* relationship.
- in *class-based* object oriented programming, *abstract type* can be implemented as *abtract class* that may include *abstract properties* or *abstract methods*.

### Abstract Classes in Java

  1. can have properties and methods.
  2. by default all methods in abstract class are concrete, unless an `abstract` keyword is used. An abstract method do not have implementation.
  3. a child class inheriting from an abstract class must override all the abstract methods.

```java
abstract class Demo {
  private int count;
  abstract public int sum(int x, int y);
  public int product(int x, int y) {
    return x * y;
  }
}
```

## Protocal/Interface

### Concepts

- a common means for discrete objects to communicate with each other.
- *has-a* relationship.

### Interface in Java

  1. do not have properties.
  2. only haves methods that can not have implementation.
  3. class that implementing the interface must override all the methods in the interface.

```java
public interface Demo {
  int sum(int x, int y);
}
```

## Comparisons

- abstract classes is used for *code reusability*, while interface helps to achieve *loose coupling*.

## Problems

### How to use C++ to implement 'interface'?

- place constructor in `protected` to avoid instantiation.

```c++
class Strategy {
  public:
   ~Strategy();
   virtual void algorithm() = 0;
  protected:
   Strategy();
}
```

### How to use concrete to simulate 'interface'?

```java
public class MockInterface {
  protected MockInterface();
  public void funcA () {
    throw new MethodUnsupportedException();
  }
}
```
