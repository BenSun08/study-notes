# How to Connect your react app to the backend api

## 1. Using Proxy

1. install the `http-proxy-middleware` as _devDependencies_.
2. create a _setupProxy.js_ configuration file under the _src_ directory.
3. proxy request to target:

```js
module.exports = (app) => {
  app.use(
    "api",
    createProxyMiddleware({
      target: "http://127.0.0.1:8888",
      //target: "http://[::1]:8888" is also right.
    })
  );
};
```

> There is an issue in MacOS: when the `[::1]` replaces by `localhost`, an error will prompt: 'Error occurred while trying to proxy request from ... to ...'.[reference](https://github.com/saikat/react-apollo-starter-kit/issues/20#issuecomment-316651403).
> `::1` is a shortened notation of IPv6 loopback address - equivalent of IPv4 loopback `127.0.0.1`
