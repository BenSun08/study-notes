# The Problem I encountered When I used SASS; What is NPM an How it Works?

## 1. SASS (_node-sass_ is deprecated, _dart-sass_ would be preferred)

1. `@use`
2. `sass:map`
3. Javascript API

   > 1. in _webpack_ based directory _sass-loader_ is needed, and [config options](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/). `functions` is need to be config.

## 1. NPM

1. SemVer

---

## Others

1. use `eject` script can expose some hidden config file in the directory, see the md file _CRACustomization.md_
2. _tsconfig.json_ optons: use `baseURL`, `paths` to define the absolue path
3. `module` in js file
4. [share variables between js and sass](https://itnext.io/sharing-variables-between-js-and-sass-using-webpack-sass-loader-713f51fa7fa0)
5. `const sassUtils = require("node-sass-utils")(sass);`: `require`'s syntax and meaning.
