## Why?

Shortcomings of empirical metrics:

1. Its result depends on the platform(computer, programming language, etc.). But algorithms are *platform-independent*.
2. Its result also depends on the *input-size* of the data.

## Big O Notation

Represents the *asymptotic upper bound* of a function.

### Arithmetic Operation

#### 1. Addition

  if
  $$
    T_1(n) = O(g(n)),
    T_2(n) = O(f(n)),
  $$
  â€‹  then
  $$
    T_1(n) + T_2(n) = max(O(g(n)), O(f(n))) = O(max(g(n), f(n))).
  $$

#### 2. Multiplication

  $$
    T_1(n) * T_2(n) = O(g(n)) *O(f(n))) = O(g(n)* f(n))
  $$

### Common Time Complexities
