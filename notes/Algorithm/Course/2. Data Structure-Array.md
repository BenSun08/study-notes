# Array Data Structure

## Definition

One of the **linear list**. A linear collection of items *of the same type* that stored in *contiguous memory locations*, each identified by at least one array index or key.

### Comparison with Linked List

- You can *randomly access* an element in an array by index, with $O(1)$ time complexity.
- Time complexity for *insertion* and *deletion* is pretty high(both $O(n)$).

## Insertion and Deletion

### Insertion

- to insert an element in an array, you have to move elements with index larger than k 1 offset backwards.
- or you can just insert the element in an array, and put the replaced element in the end of the array.

### Deletion

- delete specific element, and move all elements after the removed element 1 offset forewards.
- or you do not move elements until several deletion operation has been executed(the philosophy of *Java garbage collection*).

## Dynamic Array

The array that can automatically resize when number of elements exceed the capacity of the array.
