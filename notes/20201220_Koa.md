# Learning Koa

I learn Koa by following instructions from [kick-off-koa](https://github.com/koajs/kick-off-koa)

## 1. Learing Progress

1. Routing: _koa-router_.
2. Request body(payload) parsing: _body-parser_. Why we need to do this? Because there is no body in the `request` object by default. [As _Nodejs_ explained](https://nodejs.dev/learn/get-http-request-body-data-using-nodejs):
   > The `request` object passed in the connection callback is a stream. So, we must listen for the body content to be processed and it's processed in chunks.
3. Reponse Body: response with a stream: `fs.createReadStream()`
4. Content Headers:

   1. _Content-Type_: req: `ctx.request.type`; rsp: `ctx.type`.
   2. _Content-Length_: req: `ctx.request.length`; rsp: `ctx.length`.
   3. Determine the MIME type of req: `ctx.is()`.
   4. Set the rsp headers: `ctx.set()`. The middleware that set the response time into header:

   ```js
   const responseTime = async (ctx, next) => {
     const start = new Date();
     await next();
     const time = new Date() - start;
     ctx.set("X-response-Time", `${time}ms`);
   };
   ```

   > principle: Koa invoke "downstream", then controls flow back "upstream"[Cascading](https://koajs.com/#application).

5. Error handling:
   **Each Koa app is an instance of EventEmitter** There for:

   ```js
   app.on('error', (err, ctx) => {
      ...
   })
   ```

   customized err handler: [try/catch statement](https://github.com/koajs/koa/blob/master/docs/error-handling.md)
   You can `app.emit('error')` in the middleware so that you can handle error that koa don't catch.

6. Cookies:
   1. [The mechanism of Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)
   2. process:
      > `ctx.cookies.get()` from koa => `req.cookies()` from express.
      > `ctx.cookies.set()` from koa => `res.cookies()` from express.
      > `app.keys = []` set signed cookies keys. [What is signed cookies keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11897965/what-are-signed-cookies-in-connect-expressjs).
7. Session(_koa-session_):
   Many Chinese aritcles try to explain what is session contrast to cookie. But most of them are so confused and cause misunderstanings.
   After I looking over some materials, I think 'session' is not a accurate concept. Actually, it may refer to 'session-based authentication', 'cookies-based session' which store session data on the client with cookie, or a 'sever-based session' which only store session identifier on the client but session data on the server. Cookies are commonly used to implement sessions. References are as belows:

   > [Authentication](https://scotch.io/tutorials/the-ins-and-outs-of-token-based-authentication).
   > [session auth. vs token auth.](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/81756/session-authentication-vs-token-authentication).
   > [signing and encrypting](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/454048/what-is-the-difference-between-encrypting-and-signing-in-asymmetric-encryption).

8. Templating(_koa-views_, _ejs_):
   Render a html using a template engine. Just like interpolation. Given a template, you can interpolate a value in to the place you want.

## 2. Key Node.js APIs

1. `process.argv`
2. `fs`(File System): `fs.createReadStrem() => <stream.Readable>`: This method can use to download file from client.
3. `__dirname`: the absolute path of current file. If you want to use customized path pattern, you can create your _jsconfig.json_ for VSCode.
4. `Stream`
5. `Events`
