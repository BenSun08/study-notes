# TypeORM

## 1. Connection, Entity Manager and Repository

> `Connection` does not setup a database connection, instead it setup a connection pool.
> `Entity Manager` is just like a collection of all entity repositories in a single place.
> `Repository`'s operations are limit to a concrete entity.

## 2. Active Record vs Data Mapper

> Active Reacord pattern is an approach to access the database within the models.
> Data Mapper pattern is an approach to access the database in seperate classes called "repositories"

## 3. Relations

### 1. one-to-one

> 1. There must be an `@JoinColumn` on only one side of relation.
> 2. There can be an `@OneToOne` on both sides of relation (_bi-directional_).

### 2. many-to-one/one-to-many

> 1. `@OneToMany` can not exist without `@ManyToOne`. However, the inverse is not requied.
> 2. `@JoinColumn` can be omit. The join column/foreign key is contained in the many-to-one side.

### 3. many-to-many

> 1. `@JoinTable` is required on only one side of the relation.
> 2. `@ManyToMany` can be on one side(_uni-directional_) or both sides(_bi-directional_) of the relation.
> 3. New Entity should be created in case additional properties to the many-to-many relationship is needed.

## 4. Transaction

> **Transaction** is a small unit of program, which may contains lowlevel tasks. A Transaction must maintain _Atomicity_, _Consistency_, _Isolation_ and _Durability_. A classical example is transferring money from one bank to another bank. To do that, money is withdraw from source account, then is deposited to the destination account. The process has to succeed in full. If it stops halfway, the money will lost.[tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/dbms_transaction.htm)
> A _Transaction_ in database can have one of the following states:

## 5. Listeners & Subscribers

## 6. Migrations

> A migration is just a single file with sql queries to update a database schema and apply new changes to an existing database.[link](https://typeorm.io/#/migrations/how-migrations-work)
